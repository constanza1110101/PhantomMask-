PhantomMask is a powerful privacy-enhancing tool that dynamically alters browser fingerprints, blocks tracking attempts, and enhances online anonymity using Puppeteer and stealth techniques.

Features

🕵️ Fingerprint Spoofing – Alters browser attributes to avoid detection.

🔒 Anti-Tracking – Blocks known tracking scripts automatically.

🌍 Geolocation Spoofing – Sets fake latitude and longitude.

🔄 Session Fingerprint Hashing – Generates a unique hash per session for extra security.

Installation

npm install puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth

Usage

Save the script as PhantomMask.js.

Run the script:

node PhantomMask.js

Example Output
